            Muhammad Ali, born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr., was an American professional boxer, philanthropist, and cultural icon. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest heavyweight boxers of all time.
            Ali's charisma, quick wit, and powerful punches made him a dominant force in the ring. His famous catchphrase, "Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee," became synonymous with his boxing style.
            Beyond boxing, Ali was an advocate for civil rights, religious freedom, and social justice. His refusal to be drafted into the Vietnam War due to his religious beliefs made him a controversial figure but also solidified his status as a principled athlete.
